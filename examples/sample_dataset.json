      "title": "Climate Change",
      "text": "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun's heat and raising temperatures. Examples of greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and forests can also release carbon dioxide. Landfills for garbage are a major source of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main emitters. Greenhouse gas concentrations are at their highest levels in 2 million years and continue to rise. As a result, the Earth is now about 1.1°C warmer than it was in the 1800s. The last decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record. Many people think climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system, where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all others. The consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.",

      "title": "Artificial Intelligence",
      "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans. AI research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals. The term 'artificial intelligence' had previously been used to describe machines that mimic and display human cognitive skills that are associated with the human mind, such as learning and problem-solving. This definition has since been rejected by major AI researchers who now describe AI in terms of rationality and acting rationally, which does not limit how intelligence can be articulated. AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go). As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require 'intelligence' are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an 'AI winter'), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches since its founding, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical-statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.",
      "reference_summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to natural intelligence in humans and animals. Modern AI research focuses on systems that perceive their environment and take actions to achieve goals, rather than simply mimicking human cognition. Applications include web search engines, recommendation systems, voice assistants, self-driving cars, generative tools, and strategic games. The field has experienced cycles of optimism and disappointment since its founding in 1956. While early approaches varied widely, the 21st century has seen the dominance of mathematical-statistical machine learning, which has proven highly successful in solving challenging problems across industry and academia."

      "title": "Renewable Energy",
      "text": "Renewable energy is energy derived from natural resources that are replenished at a higher rate than they are consumed. Sunlight and wind, for example, are such sources that are constantly being replenished. Renewable energy sources are plentiful and all around us. Fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - on the other hand, are non-renewable resources that take hundreds of millions of years to form. Fossil fuels, when burned to produce energy, cause harmful greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide. Generating renewable energy creates far lower emissions than burning fossil fuels. Transitioning from fossil fuels, which currently account for the lion's share of emissions, to renewable energy is key to addressing the climate crisis. Renewables are now cheaper in most countries, and generate three times more jobs than fossil fuels. The main sources of renewable energy are: Solar energy from the sun, Wind energy, Hydro energy from flowing water, Biomass from plants, Geothermal energy from the earth. Solar energy is one of the most common and fastest-growing sources of renewable energy. Solar panel costs have dropped 89 percent since 2010, making solar power significantly more affordable for more people. Renewable energy is important because it accelerates the phase-out of fossil fuels and the transition to greener economies. Countries that implement comprehensive renewable energy plans accelerate the phase-out of fossil fuel and the transition to low-carbon economies. These green plans generate jobs, strengthen energy security, deliver financial returns, lower costs, and clean up our air and ecosystems. In 2019, 11 percent of the world's primary global energy came from renewable sources. However, the world has only tapped a small amount of its vast renewable energy resources. Capacity for generating electricity from renewable sources has increased dramatically, jumping 10.3 percent in 2020 to 2,799 gigawatts. That is only the beginning of what renewables could contribute.",

        "The human brain is the central organ of the human nervous system, and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system. The brain consists of the cerebrum, the brainstem and the cerebellum. It controls most of the activities of the body, processing, integrating, and coordinating the information it receives from the sense organs, and making decisions as to the instructions sent to the rest of the body.",
        "The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain. It is divided into two cerebral hemispheres. The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter, covering the core of white matter. The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex. The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers, while the allocortex has three or four. Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes – the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes.",
        "The brainstem is the posterior part of the brain, continuous with the spinal cord. It consists of the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. The brainstem provides the main motor and sensory nerve supply to the face and neck via the cranial nerves. Of the twelve pairs of cranial nerves, ten pairs come off the brainstem.",
        "The cerebellum is a major feature of the hindbrain of all vertebrates. In humans, the cerebellum plays an important role in motor control. It may also be involved in some cognitive functions such as attention and language as well as emotional control such as regulating fear and pleasure responses."
